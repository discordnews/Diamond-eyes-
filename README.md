Discord can indeed be hacked. A user should immediately inform Discord of suspicious activity on the platform or if they suspect their account has been hacked. If you suspect your account has been hacked you should change your password and then inform your friends about the hacking.

Is It Easy To Hack Discord?
Itâ€™s easy to hack Discord, but that doesnâ€™t mean users are 100% unsafe there. While highly skilled hackers will always find their way in, Discord does its best to root out hacking activity. Discord encourages users to report security vulnerabilities and removes malware found in security scans.

According to Sophos IT Security Company, Discord provides hackers with a highly available and target-rich global distribution network. In other words, Discord is a good target for hackers.

Due to the highly social nature of the platform, Discord makes it an ideal place for hackers to spread malicious malware and code through social engineering.
